OpenFst - Release 1.1

   * Added compat.h to src/include/fst to fix missing defines
   * Fixed bug in acyclic minimization that led to non-minimal 
     (but equiv) results
   * Fixed missing FST typedef in various matchers in matcher.h
     so that they can be cascaded
   * Opened file streams binary where appropriate

OpenFst - Release 1.0

   Additions to beta version:

   * Matcher class added for matching labels at FST states. Includes
     special matchers for sigma (any), rho ('rest'), and phi ('fail')

   * Composition generalized with arbitrary filters, matchers, and state tables.
     Sequence and matching composition filters provided. (see compose.h, 
     compose-filter.h, matcher.h, state-table.h)
   * Unique n-best (see shortest-path.h)
   * Pruning in determinization and epsilon removal (see determinize.h, 
     rmepsilon.h)
   * New Fst classes: 
      * Compact Fsts for space-efficient representation (see compact-fst.h)
   * New Weight classes:
